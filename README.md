## Overview

### The challenge

“As a student, I want to organize my time in a way that all of my chores fit up in my schedule, track my process and visualize all of my tasks.”

## Our process
We initiated the project by coding the HTML structure and incorporating basic CSS styling. Additionally, we decided to utilize the Bootstrap library for modals and buttons on the webpage. Upon completing the basic structure, we introduced interactivity to the application using JavaScript. This involved implementing functions that allowed users to add new tasks, save them locally using local storage, and render the tasks as cards. Subsequently, we enhanced the application with more advanced logic, including the ability to edit tasks and more sophisticated styling to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive
- JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


### What I learned

We reinforced our knowledge about web development learned trought the bootcamp experience. We used technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and libraries like Bootstrap implementing modals and bootstrap native functions to develop our first project and adapted our code to have a responsive design. In addition we practiced our team work skills by using github repositories to code our app.
